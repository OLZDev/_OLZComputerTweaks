## PC Tweaks menu by: _OLZ (me)

This is a PC Tweaks menu. 
This menu allows you to do complicated or very basic things with windows that would usually take more time if done through, say a settings menu. 
It also allows you to program your own functions if you understand the Batch Script Language. Because the program is 100% open-source, meaning all of the code is public and anyone with at least a few brain cells can access it and make changes to **THE VERSION THEY HAVE NOT THE GITHUB**.
